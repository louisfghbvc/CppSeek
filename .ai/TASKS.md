### üü° In Progress Tasks
- [-] **ID 11: Set up FAISS vector storage system (EXPANDED)** (Priority: high)
> Dependencies: 10
> Set up FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) vector database for efficient vector storage and similarity search in the CppSeek VSCode extension, with native binding support and environment compatibility. This task has been expanded to systematically address environment compatibility issues and implement native bindings where possible.

  - [ ] **ID 11.1: Environment Setup & Toolchain Configuration** (Priority: critical)
  > Dependencies: 11
  > Configure CentOS7 compatible toolchain to support native binding compilation for FAISS and SQLite3, enabling enhanced performance while maintaining JavaScript fallbacks.
  
  - [ ] **ID 11.2: SQLite3 Native Binding Implementation** (Priority: high)
  > Dependencies: 11.1
  > Compile and implement SQLite3 native bindings using compatible CentOS7 toolchain, enabling high-performance metadata operations while maintaining JavaScript fallback compatibility.
  
  - [ ] **ID 11.3: FAISS Native Binding Investigation** (Priority: medium)  
  > Dependencies: 11.1
  > Investigate and attempt to resolve FAISS native binding compilation issues, specifically addressing the GLIBC 2.27 dependency requirement that exceeds current system capabilities.
  
  - [ ] **ID 11.4: Hybrid Vector Storage Implementation** (Priority: high)
  > Dependencies: 11.2, 11.3  
  > Implement hybrid vector storage architecture combining the best available components: native SQLite3 for metadata (high performance) + JavaScript vectors for similarity search (reliable compatibility).
  
  - [ ] **ID 11.5: Environment Testing & Validation** (Priority: high)
  > Dependencies: 11.4
  > Comprehensive testing and validation of the hybrid vector storage implementation across different environment configurations, ensuring robust operation and proper fallback behavior.

- [ ] **ID 12: Implement cosine similarity search algorithm** (Priority: medium)
> Dependencies: 11
> Implement cosine similarity search algorithm for vector comparison and ranking in the CppSeek semantic search system.

### ‚ö™ Pending Tasks
- ‚è≥ Task 13: Create search results ranking system
- ‚è≥ Task 14: Implement search result presentation
- ‚è≥ Task 15: Add search history and bookmarks
- ‚è≥ Task 16: Create search filters and refinement
- ‚è≥ Task 17: Implement real-time indexing
- ‚è≥ Task 18: Add search analytics and metrics
- ‚è≥ Task 19: Create search preferences and settings
- ‚è≥ Task 20: Implement search result caching

## Current Focus
**Active Task**: Task 11 - Set up FAISS vector storage system (Phase 2: Native Enhancement)
**Sub-task Priority**: Task 11.1 - Environment Setup & Toolchain Configuration
**Status**: Ready to begin native binding implementation with CentOS7 tools

## Notes
- **Task 11 Expanded**: Originally completed with JavaScript fallbacks, now enhanced with native binding support
- **Phase 1 Completed**: Pure JavaScript implementation (JSVectorStorage + MemoryMetadataStore) ‚úÖ
- **Phase 2 Active**: Native binding enhancement with hybrid architecture approach
- **Environment Available**: CentOS7 GCC 10.3.0 + SQLite 3.42.0 for compatible native bindings
- **Hybrid Strategy**: Native SQLite3 + JavaScript vectors for optimal performance and compatibility
- **Task Magic Format**: All tasks now follow standard Task Magic format with proper ID numbering and structure
