# CppSeek - Semantic Search VSCode Extension
**Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

## Executive Summary

CppSeek is a VSCode extension that revolutionizes code search by providing semantic understanding of C/C++ codebases. Instead of relying on exact text matching, developers can use natural language queries like "Where is the init logic?" to find relevant code, significantly improving development efficiency and code exploration.

## Project Overview

### Vision Statement
Transform how developers search and understand C/C++ codebases by providing AI-powered semantic search capabilities that understand code intent rather than just syntax.

### Problem Statement
- **Current Pain**: Traditional code search requires exact keyword matching, making it difficult to find relevant code without knowing specific variable/function names
- **Developer Friction**: New team members struggle to navigate large codebases effectively  
- **Time Waste**: Developers spend excessive time manually searching through files
- **Context Loss**: Existing tools don't understand semantic relationships between code components

### Solution Overview
CppSeek provides:
1. **Natural Language Search**: Query code using questions like "Where is the init logic?"
2. **Semantic Understanding**: Find code by functionality, not just exact text matches
3. **Context-Aware Results**: Show relevant code snippets with proper context and relationships
4. **Seamless Integration**: Works naturally within VSCode workflow

## Development Phases

### 📦 Phase 1: Basic Functionality (Weeks 1-3)
**Goal**: Establish end-to-end semantic search pipeline

#### 🔧 Foundation Components
- **VSCode Extension Scaffold**: Use `yo code` to create extension structure
- **Command Integration**: Implement command palette entry point
- **Basic UI**: Simple query input interface

#### 📁 Code Processing Pipeline  
- **File Discovery**: Use `vscode.workspace.findFiles` for `.cpp/.h` files
- **Content Reading**: Read and parse file contents
- **Fixed-Size Chunking**: Simple text-based chunking with fixed size (e.g., 500 tokens)
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain some overlap between chunks for continuity

#### 🔗 Embedding & Search
- **Embedding Service**: Nvidia NIM (Nvidia Inference Microservices) with llama-3.2-nv-embedqa-1b-v2
- **Deployment**: Local containerized inference service via NIM
- **Vector Storage**: FAISS for local similarity search  
- **Basic Search**: Cosine similarity matching with top-5 results

#### 🎯 Phase 1 Deliverables
- [ ] Extension loads and activates in VSCode
- [ ] Command palette integration working

- [ ] Enhanced search result preview with semantic context
- [ ] Side panel integration complete
- [ ] File watcher for automatic index updates
- [ ] Improved search accuracy and relevance
- [ ] Production-ready extension for marketplace
