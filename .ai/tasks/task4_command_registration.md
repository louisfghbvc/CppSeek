## Description

Register the core CppSeek commands in VSCode command palette and verify the extension activation and command execution works correctly. This establishes the basic user interface entry points for the semantic search functionality.

## Details

- Configure extension activation in `package.json`:
  - Set `activationEvents` to `["onLanguage:cpp", "onLanguage:c", "onCommand:cppseek.semanticSearch"]`
  - Add `main` entry point to compiled extension
  - Set minimum VSCode engine version
- Define commands in `package.json` contributes section:
  - `cppseek.semanticSearch`: Main semantic search command
  - `cppseek.indexWorkspace`: Index current workspace command
  - `cppseek.clearIndex`: Clear search index command
  - `cppseek.showSettings`: Show extension settings command
- Implement command handlers in `src/extension.ts`:
  - Create `activate()` function that registers all commands
  - Implement command callback functions with proper error handling
  - Add basic status bar integration for indexing progress
  - Set up output channel for extension logging
- Create command implementations:
  - `semanticSearch`: Show input box for search query and placeholder results
  - `indexWorkspace`: Scan workspace for C/C++ files and show count
  - `clearIndex`: Clear any existing index data with confirmation
  - `showSettings`: Open extension settings in VSCode preferences
- Add keyboard shortcuts in `package.json`:
  - `Ctrl+Shift+S` (Cmd+Shift+S on Mac) for semantic search
  - Configure when clauses for C/C++ file contexts
- Implement basic extension state management:
  - Track activation state
  - Store workspace-specific settings
  - Handle extension deactivation cleanup
- Add extension configuration schema:
  - Basic settings for search behavior
  - File inclusion/exclusion patterns
  - Performance tuning options

## Test Strategy

- Load extension in Development Host and verify no activation errors
- Test each command appears in Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
- Verify keyboard shortcuts work when editing C/C++ files
- Execute each command and verify basic functionality:
  - Search command shows input box
  - Index command scans workspace files
  - Clear command shows confirmation dialog
  - Settings command opens correct preferences page
- Test extension activation on opening C/C++ files
- Verify status bar integration shows proper states
- Check output channel shows extension logging
- Confirm extension deactivates cleanly when VSCode closes

## Agent Notes

✅ **Task 4 Successfully Completed!**

**Implementation Summary:**

1. **Package.json Configuration**:
   - ✅ Updated `activationEvents` to include C/C++ language activation and command-based activation
   - ✅ Defined 4 core commands with proper categories: `semanticSearch`, `indexWorkspace`, `clearIndex`, `showSettings`
   - ✅ Added keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+S` (Cmd+Shift+S on Mac) for semantic search when editing C/C++ files
   - ✅ Created comprehensive configuration schema with 7 settings categories covering search behavior, file patterns, and performance tuning

2. **Extension Implementation (src/extension.ts)**:
   - ✅ Complete command registration system with proper error handling
   - ✅ Status bar integration showing indexing progress and file counts with icons
   - ✅ Output channel for comprehensive logging with timestamps
   - ✅ Extension state management tracking activation, indexing status, and file counts
   - ✅ Welcome dialog for first-time users with quick action buttons
   - ✅ All 4 command handlers implemented with:
     - `semanticSearch`: Input validation, progress indicators, mock search results
     - `indexWorkspace`: File pattern scanning, progress reporting, workspace validation
     - `clearIndex`: Confirmation dialogs, state cleanup
     - `showSettings`: Direct integration with VSCode preferences

3. **Testing Framework**:
   - ✅ Enhanced Jest mocks for all VSCode APIs used (OutputChannel, StatusBarItem, Progress, Configuration)
   - ✅ 4 comprehensive tests passing covering activation, deactivation, command execution
   - ✅ Proper Promise-based mocking for VSCode async APIs
   - ✅ Complete test coverage for command registration verification

4. **Build & Package**:
   - ✅ Production build successful: 6.31 KiB optimized bundle 
   - ✅ TypeScript compilation without errors
   - ✅ ESLint validation passed
   - ✅ Webpack bundling with proper externals for VSCode API

**Command Palette Integration Verified:**
- 4 commands properly categorized under "CppSeek" category
- Activation on C/C++ file editing
- Keyboard shortcut registration with context awareness
- Full configuration schema for user customization

**Foundation Setup Complete:** All 4 foundation tasks (scaffold, TypeScript environment, testing framework, command registration) are now complete. Ready for core semantic search implementation in Phase 2.
