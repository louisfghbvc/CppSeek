## Description

Set up the basic VSCode extension structure using the official Yeoman generator (`yo code`). This will create the foundation for the CppSeek semantic search extension with proper TypeScript configuration and VSCode extension manifest.

## Details

- Install Yeoman generator for VSCode extensions (`npm install -g yo generator-code`)
- Run `yo code` and select TypeScript extension template
- Configure extension metadata in package.json:
  - **Extension ID**: `cppseek-semantic-search`
  - **Display Name**: `CppSeek - Semantic Search`
  - **Description**: `AI-powered semantic search for C/C++ codebases`
  - **Categories**: `Other, Programming Languages`
  - **Activation Events**: `onLanguage:cpp, onLanguage:c`
- Verify the generated directory structure includes:
  - `src/extension.ts` (main entry point)
  - `package.json` (extension manifest)
  - `tsconfig.json` (TypeScript configuration)
  - `webpack.config.js` (build configuration)
- Configure basic command registration placeholder in package.json
- Ensure extension can be loaded in VSCode development environment
- Set up proper TypeScript compilation settings for VSCode extension development

## Test Strategy

- Run `npm install` in the generated project directory
- Open the project in VSCode
- Press F5 to launch Extension Development Host
- Verify extension appears in Extensions view
- Check that no compilation errors occur
- Verify basic extension activation works without errors
- Confirm the extension can be packaged using `vsce package`

## Context
This is the first task in Phase 1 of the CppSeek project. We need to establish the basic extension structure that will serve as the foundation for all subsequent development.

## Requirements
- Use `yo code` generator to create extension scaffold
- Configure for TypeScript development
- Set up basic extension manifest (package.json)
- Create initial directory structure
- Configure basic VSCode extension entry point

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Extension scaffold created successfully
- [ ] Extension loads without errors in VSCode
- [ ] Basic command registration works
- [ ] TypeScript configuration is properly set up
- [ ] Extension manifest has correct metadata

## Technical Details

### Prerequisites
```bash
npm install -g yo generator-code
```

### Directory Structure Expected
```
cppseek/
├── src/
│   ├── extension.ts      # Main extension entry point
│   └── test/            # Test files
├── package.json         # Extension manifest
├── tsconfig.json        # TypeScript configuration
├── webpack.config.js    # Build configuration
└── README.md           # Basic documentation
```

### Extension Configuration
- **Extension ID**: cppseek-semantic-search
- **Display Name**: CppSeek - Semantic Search
- **Description**: AI-powered semantic search for C/C++ codebases
- **Categories**: Other, Programming Languages
- **Activation Events**: onLanguage:cpp, onLanguage:c

### Basic Command Setup
```typescript
// Initial command registration
{
  "command": "cppseek.semanticSearch",
  "title": "CppSeek: Semantic Search",
  "category": "CppSeek"
}
```

## Dependencies
- None (this is the first task)

## Estimated Time
- 2-3 hours

## Success Metrics
- Extension can be loaded in VSCode development environment
- Basic command appears in command palette
- No TypeScript compilation errors
- Extension follows VSCode extension best practices

## Next Steps
After completion, proceed to Task 2: Set up TypeScript development environment and dependencies.

## Notes
- Follow VSCode extension development best practices
- Ensure extension can be packaged and distributed later
- Set up proper TypeScript configuration for future development
- Configure webpack for optimal bundle size

## Agent Notes

**Task Completed Successfully** - 2025-07-15T07:00:47Z

**Implementation Summary**:
- ✅ Installed Yeoman and VSCode extension generator globally
- ✅ Created extension scaffold using `yo code` with TypeScript template
- ✅ Configured extension metadata as specified:
  - Extension ID: `cppseek-semantic-search`
  - Display Name: `CppSeek - Semantic Search`
  - Description: `AI-powered semantic search for C/C++ codebases`
  - Categories: `Other, Programming Languages`
  - Activation Events: `onLanguage:cpp, onLanguage:c`
- ✅ Verified TypeScript compilation works correctly
- ✅ Confirmed Webpack bundling is properly configured
- ✅ All linting rules pass (ESLint)
- ✅ Extension packaging capability verified with VSCE

**Directory Structure Created**:
```
/src/
  /test/
  extension.ts
package.json
tsconfig.json
webpack.config.js
.vscode/
  launch.json (Extension Development Host configuration)
  tasks.json
  settings.json
  extensions.json
```

**Build System Verified**:
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ Working
- Webpack bundling: ✅ Working (dev + production modes)
- ESLint: ✅ Configured and passing
- VSCE packaging: ✅ Functional

**Next Steps**: Task 2 ready to start - TypeScript dependencies installation
