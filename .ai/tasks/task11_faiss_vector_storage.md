## Description

Set up FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) vector database for efficient vector storage and similarity search in the CppSeek VSCode extension, with native binding support and environment compatibility. This task has been expanded to systematically address environment compatibility issues and implement native bindings where possible.

## Details

### Task Expansion Strategy
This task uses a two-phase approach:
- **Phase 1**: JavaScript fallbacks ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Phase 2**: Native binding enhancement üîÑ **IN PROGRESS**

### Sub-tasks Created
- **Task 11.1**: Environment Setup & Toolchain Configuration (Priority: critical)
- **Task 11.2**: SQLite3 Native Binding Implementation (Priority: high)  
- **Task 11.3**: FAISS Native Binding Investigation (Priority: medium)
- **Task 11.4**: Hybrid Vector Storage Implementation (Priority: high)
- **Task 11.5**: Environment Testing & Validation (Priority: high)

### Phase 1 Achievements ‚úÖ
- **Files Created**:
  - `src/services/vectorStorage/types.ts`: TypeScript interfaces and types
  - `src/services/vectorStorage/jsVectorStorage.ts`: Pure JavaScript vector storage with cosine similarity
  - `src/services/vectorStorage/memoryMetadataStore.ts`: In-memory metadata store with JSON persistence
  - `src/services/vectorStorage/index.ts`: Clean export interface using only JS implementations
  - `src/config/vectorStorageConfig.ts`: Configuration management integrated with VSCode

- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Vector Storage: In-memory storage with cosine similarity search
  - Metadata Store: JSON-based persistence with file tracking
  - Configuration: Integrated with VSCode settings API
  - Fallback Strategy: Pure JavaScript implementations for maximum compatibility

### Phase 2 Enhancement Goals
- **Environment Analysis**: CentOS7 compatible GCC 10.3.0 and SQLite 3.42.0 available in `/home/utils/`
- **Compatibility**: GCC 10.3.0 provides CXXABI_1.3.8+ required for native bindings
- **Target Architecture**:
  ```typescript
  // Hybrid approach: Native SQLite + JS Vectors
  export class HybridVectorStorage {
    private vectors: JSVectorStorage;      // JavaScript fallback (proven)
    private metadata: MetadataStore;       // Native SQLite3 (enhanced performance)
  }
  ```

### Known Challenges Addressed
- **FAISS Issue**: Requires GLIBC 2.27, system has GLIBC 2.17 (5-year gap)
- **SQLite3 Success**: Previous testing confirmed SQLite3 rebuilds successfully with compatible toolchain
- **Hybrid Strategy**: Combine best available components for optimal performance

## Test Strategy

### Phase 1 Testing Results ‚úÖ
```
‚úÖ Pure JS Vector storage imports successful!
   üè≠ Vector Storage: JSVectorStorage
   üóÑÔ∏è Metadata Store: MemoryMetadataStore
   ‚öôÔ∏è Select Optimal Index: function
‚úÖ Instantiation successful!
   üìä Vector Storage instance created
   üóÑÔ∏è Metadata Store instance created
```

### Phase 2 Testing Plan
1. **Environment Setup Validation** (Task 11.1):
   - Verify GCC 10.3.0 toolchain setup
   - Test CXXABI_1.3.8+ availability
   - Validate build environment configuration

2. **Native Binding Testing** (Task 11.2):
   - SQLite3 native compilation and import testing
   - Performance comparison: native vs memory store
   - Integration testing with existing vector storage

3. **FAISS Investigation** (Task 11.3):
   - GLIBC dependency analysis
   - Compilation attempts with compatible toolchain
   - Documentation of limitations and alternatives

4. **Hybrid Implementation** (Task 11.4):
   - Combined architecture testing
   - Adaptive loading system validation
   - Performance optimization verification

5. **Final Validation** (Task 11.5):
   - Comprehensive environment testing
   - Real-world integration with C++ files
   - Performance benchmarking and documentation

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Sub-tasks 11.1-11.5 completed successfully
- [ ] Hybrid vector storage with native SQLite3 + JS vectors operational
- [ ] Automatic fallback behavior working reliably
- [ ] Performance improvements demonstrated for metadata operations
- [ ] Complete documentation and deployment guide created
- [ ] Production-ready implementation validated across different environments

## Agent Notes

**Current Status**: Phase 1 completed successfully with JavaScript fallbacks. Phase 2 expansion in progress to enhance with native bindings where possible while maintaining reliability and compatibility.

**Next Action**: Execute Task 11.1 (Environment Setup & Toolchain Configuration) to begin native binding enhancement phase.
