# Active Context

## Current Sprint Status: Code Processing Pipeline Started

**Phase 1: Foundation Setup** âœ… **COMPLETE**
- All 4 foundation tasks successfully implemented
- Extension fully functional with command palette integration
- Production-ready development environment established

**Phase 2: Code Processing Pipeline** ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS**
- Tasks 5-6 (File Discovery & Text Chunking) completed successfully
- Ready for Tasks 7-8: File content reading and overlap logic
- Core infrastructure with file discovery + chunking pipeline in place

## Most Recent Completion: Task 6 - Text Chunking Logic

**Date:** 2025-07-17T07:01:13Z
**Status:** âœ… Successfully completed

### What Was Accomplished

**Core Text Chunking System:**
- âœ… `TextChunker` class with Llama-compatible tokenization using @xenova/transformers
- âœ… Fixed-size chunking logic (500 tokens with 50-token configurable overlap)
- âœ… Dynamic ES module import for @xenova/transformers compatibility
- âœ… Smart boundary detection for functions, classes, statements, comments, and preprocessor directives
- âœ… Comprehensive chunk metadata including line numbers, character positions, and overlap regions
- âœ… Performance optimization with tokenization caching and streaming support for large files

**Chunking Infrastructure:**
- âœ… Configurable chunk sizes (100-2000 tokens) and overlap (10-200 tokens) via VSCode settings
- âœ… Fallback tokenizer for environments where @xenova/transformers cannot load
- âœ… Unicode and special character handling for international code comments
- âœ… Integration with indexing pipeline in main extension (`handleIndexWorkspace`)
- âœ… Cache management with statistics and manual clearing capabilities

**Quality & Testing:**
- âœ… Comprehensive test suite with 12 passing tests covering all chunking functionality
- âœ… Edge case handling for empty files, Unicode content, and various C++ constructs
- âœ… Performance testing with large content and multiple chunk scenarios
- âœ… Production build: 47.3 KiB with TextChunker integration
- âœ… All TypeScript compilation, linting, and webpack bundling successful

## Foundation Phase Summary

**All 4 Foundation Tasks Complete:**
1. âœ… **Extension Scaffold** - VSCode extension structure with proper metadata
2. âœ… **TypeScript Environment** - Development setup with modern tooling and Llama tokenization
3. âœ… **Testing Framework** - Jest testing with 100% coverage and comprehensive VSCode mocking
4. âœ… **Command Registration** - Full command palette integration with UX polish

## Next Phase: Text Processing Pipeline

**Phase 2: Code Processing Pipeline** ðŸ”„ **CONTINUING**
- File discovery system complete and fully integrated
- Ready for text processing and chunking implementation
- Foundation + file discovery provides solid base for AI-powered features

**Immediate Next Steps:**
- **Task 7**: Implement file content reading and text processing
- **Task 8**: Set up chunk overlap logic for context continuity  
- **Task 9**: Set up Nvidia NIM local inference service
- **Task 10**: Integrate Nvidia NIM embedding API for vector generation

## Technical State

**Build System:** âœ… Fully operational
- Production builds: 6.31 KiB optimized
- Development builds with source maps
- Jest testing with comprehensive mocking
- ESLint validation and TypeScript strict mode

**Extension State:** âœ… Production ready with file discovery
- All commands functional with file discovery integration
- Robust error handling and progress reporting
- User experience polished with real-time feedback
- Configuration system complete with file pattern support

**Text Processing Pipeline:** âœ… Fully operational
- File discovery + text chunking system complete and integrated
- Recursive C/C++ file scanning with 7 supported extensions  
- 500-token chunking with smart boundary detection and Llama tokenization
- Performance optimized for large codebases (47.3 KiB bundle)
- Comprehensive testing with 26 total tests passing
- Ready for file content reading and advanced overlap logic

**Development Environment:** âœ… Comprehensive
- TypeScript with modern target (ES2022)
- Webpack bundling with externals
- Jest testing with VSCode API mocking and file system testing
- Prettier code formatting
- Complete build automation

The foundation, file discovery, and text chunking systems are now complete and ready for file content reading and advanced overlap logic implementation.
