   - Reasoning: Local deployment eliminates API dependencies and costs
   - Benefits: Full privacy control and offline capability

3. **Vector Storage**: FAISS for local vector similarity search
   - SQLite for metadata and file information
   - Local-first approach with cloud backup options

### Project Scope Decisions
4. **Phase Simplification**: Reduced from 3 phases to 2 phases (6 weeks total)

   - Benefits: Faster time to market, simpler architecture, focused value proposition
   - Trade-offs: No conversational AI interface, but maintains core search value

5. **Nvidia NIM Integration**: Local inference service approach
   - Rationale: Eliminates external API dependencies and costs
   - Implementation: Containerized local deployment
   - Benefits: Full privacy, offline capability, no usage fees

### Technical Approach Confirmed
- **Chunking Strategy**: Fixed-size chunking (Phase 1) → clangd AST-aware (Phase 2)
- **Search Algorithm**: Cosine similarity for vector matching
