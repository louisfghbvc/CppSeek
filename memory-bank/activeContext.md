# Active Context - CppSeek Extension

## Current Work Focus

### Project Status: Planning Phase
We are currently in the **planning and design phase** of the CppSeek semantic search VSCode extension. The project is structured in two main development phases with clear deliverables and milestones.

### Immediate Priority: Phase 1 Foundation
**Goal**: Establish basic semantic search functionality with core pipeline working end-to-end.

**Current Sprint Focus**:
1. **Extension Scaffold Creation**: Set up VSCode extension structure
2. **Basic Command Integration**: Implement command palette functionality
3. **File Reading Pipeline**: Establish workspace file discovery and processing
4. **Embedding Integration**: Connect to Nvidia NIM for text embedding
5. **Simple Search Interface**: Create basic search UI and result display

## Recent Decisions

### Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Chunking Strategy**: Fixed-size chunking for Phase 1 simplicity
   - Rationale: Avoid complexity of AST parsing in initial implementation
   - Implementation: 500-token chunks with 50-token overlap for continuity

2. **Embedding Model Selection**: Nvidia llama-3.2-nv-embedqa-1b-v2 for local deployment
   - Reasoning: Local deployment eliminates API dependencies and costs
   - Benefits: Full privacy control and offline capability

3. **Vector Storage**: FAISS for local vector similarity search
   - SQLite for metadata and file information
   - Local-first approach with cloud backup options

### Project Scope Decisions
4. **Phase Simplification**: Reduced from 3 phases to 2 phases (6 weeks total)
   - Rationale: Focus on core semantic search functionality without LLM chat
   - Benefits: Faster time to market, simpler architecture, focused value proposition
   - Trade-offs: No conversational AI interface, but maintains core search value

5. **Nvidia NIM Integration**: Local inference service approach
   - Rationale: Eliminates external API dependencies and costs
   - Implementation: Containerized local deployment
   - Benefits: Full privacy, offline capability, no usage fees

### Technical Approach Confirmed
- **Chunking Strategy**: Fixed-size chunking (Phase 1) â†’ clangd AST-aware (Phase 2)
- **Search Algorithm**: Cosine similarity for vector matching
- **UI Integration**: Command palette + side panel approach
- **Update Strategy**: Incremental indexing with file watchers

## Active Considerations

### Technical Challenges
1. **Performance Optimization**: Balancing search accuracy with response time
2. **Memory Management**: Efficient vector storage for large codebases
3. **Local Model Management**: Efficient Nvidia NIM deployment and resource usage
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when services fail

### User Experience Challenges
1. **Search Result Relevance**: Ensuring semantic search provides better results than text search
2. **Context Preservation**: Maintaining code context in search results
3. **Learning Curve**: Making the tool intuitive for developers
4. **Integration Workflow**: Seamless integration with existing VSCode usage patterns

### Development Challenges
1. **VSCode API Limitations**: Working within extension sandbox constraints
2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensuring consistent behavior across OS
3. **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive testing of AI-powered features
4. **Debugging Complexity**: Debugging semantic search relevance issues

## Current Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Hardware Requirements**: Local model deployment requires sufficient GPU resources
   - **Mitigation**: Optimize model loading and provide CPU fallback options
   
2. **Performance Issues**: Slow indexing on large codebases
   - **Mitigation**: Implement incremental indexing and caching

3. **Search Accuracy**: Semantic search not outperforming text search
   - **Mitigation**: Hybrid approach with text search fallback

### Product Risks
1. **User Adoption**: Developers may not see value over existing tools
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on clear value proposition and ease of use

2. **Competition**: Similar tools emerging in the market
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on C/C++ specialization and unique features

## Resource Requirements

### Development Resources
- **Primary Developer**: Full-time development and architecture
- **Testing**: Part-time QA and user testing
- **Design**: Part-time UX for interface design

### Technical Resources
- **Nvidia Models**: Local deployment setup for embeddings
- **Development Environment**: VSCode, Node.js, testing tools, GPU drivers
- **Storage**: Local development environment setup with model storage

### Timeline Considerations
- **Phase 1**: 3 weeks for MVP functionality (fixed-size chunking)
- **Phase 2**: 3 weeks for clangd integration and production polish
- **Total**: 6 weeks for complete semantic search extension

## Success Metrics for Current Phase

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] Extension loads successfully in VSCode
- [ ] Basic semantic search returns relevant results
- [ ] Search completes within 2 seconds for medium codebases
- [ ] Users can navigate to found code snippets
- [ ] Index updates automatically when files change

### Quality Gates
- [ ] All unit tests passing
- [ ] Extension passes VSCode marketplace validation
- [ ] Memory usage stays under 100MB during indexing
- [ ] No crashes or unhandled exceptions during normal use

## Learning and Adaptation
