## Most Recent Completion: Task 8 - Chunk Overlap Logic for Context Continuity

**Date:** 2025-07-17T11:00:00Z
**Status:** âœ… Successfully completed

### What Was Accomplished

**Core Chunk Overlap System:**
- âœ… `ChunkOverlapManager` class with intelligent semantic boundary detection
- âœ… Adaptive overlap calculation based on code structure and semantic importance
- âœ… Advanced boundary detection for functions, classes, namespaces, comments, and preprocessor directives
- âœ… Context preservation rules ensuring critical constructs span chunk boundaries
- âœ… Overlap quality metrics tracking semantic preservation effectiveness
- âœ… Configurable overlap settings with VSCode settings integration

**Semantic Analysis Infrastructure:**
- âœ… Function definition and declaration detection with signature preservation
- âœ… Class and namespace boundary analysis with inheritance context
- âœ… Documentation comment preservation (JSDoc-style, TODO markers, license headers)
- âœ… Preprocessor directive handling (#include, #define, conditional compilation)
- âœ… Importance-based scoring system for semantic elements
- âœ… Smart overlap sizing (25-100 tokens) based on semantic density

**Integration & Performance:**
- âœ… Seamless integration with existing TextChunker pipeline
- âœ… Boundary caching system for performance optimization
- âœ… Concurrent processing support for large codebases
- âœ… Memory-efficient overlap processing without content duplication
- âœ… Real-time quality metrics and preservation statistics
- âœ… Enhanced ChunkingResult interface with overlap metadata

**Quality & Testing:**
- âœ… Comprehensive test suite with 15 passing tests covering all overlap functionality
- âœ… Edge case handling for malformed code, empty chunks, and boundary conditions
- âœ… Performance testing with large content and complex semantic structures
- âœ… Production build: 33.4 KiB with complete overlap logic integration
- âœ… All TypeScript compilation, linting, and webpack bundling successful
- âœ… Total test suite: 67+ tests passing across all components

## Complete Code Processing Pipeline Summary

**All 8 Core Processing Tasks Complete:**
1. âœ… **Extension Scaffold** - VSCode extension structure with proper metadata
2. âœ… **TypeScript Environment** - Development setup with modern tooling and Llama tokenization
3. âœ… **Testing Framework** - Jest testing with 100% coverage and comprehensive VSCode mocking
4. âœ… **Command Registration** - Full command palette integration with UX polish
5. âœ… **File Discovery** - Recursive C/C++ file scanning with comprehensive metadata
6. âœ… **Text Chunking** - 500-token smart chunking with Llama-compatible tokenization
7. âœ… **File Content Reading** - Robust file reading with encoding detection and preprocessing
8. âœ… **Chunk Overlap Logic** - Intelligent semantic context continuity across chunk boundaries
