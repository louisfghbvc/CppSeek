   - **Priorities**: Critical priority for tasks 1-2, High for tasks 3-4
   - **Test Strategies**: Comprehensive validation proven effective

### Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Chunking Strategy**: Fixed-size chunking for Phase 1 simplicity
   - Rationale: Avoid complexity of AST parsing in initial implementation
   - Implementation: 500-token chunks with 50-token overlap for continuity

2. **Embedding Model Selection**: Nvidia llama-3.2-nv-embedqa-1b-v2 for local deployment
   - Reasoning: Local deployment eliminates API dependencies and costs
   - Benefits: Full privacy control and offline capability

3. **Vector Storage**: FAISS for local vector similarity search
   - SQLite for metadata and file information
   - Local-first approach with cloud backup options

### Project Scope Decisions
4. **Phase Simplification**: Reduced from 3 phases to 2 phases (6 weeks total)
   - Rationale: Focus on core semantic search functionality without LLM chat
   - Benefits: Faster time to market, simpler architecture, focused value proposition
   - Trade-offs: No conversational AI interface, but maintains core search value

5. **Nvidia NIM Integration**: Local inference service approach
   - Rationale: Eliminates external API dependencies and costs
   - Implementation: Containerized local deployment
   - Benefits: Full privacy, offline capability, no usage fees

### Technical Approach Confirmed
- **Chunking Strategy**: Fixed-size chunking (Phase 1) → clangd AST-aware (Phase 2)
- **Search Algorithm**: Cosine similarity for vector matching
- **UI Integration**: Command palette + side panel approach
- **Update Strategy**: Incremental indexing with file watchers

## Next Steps
