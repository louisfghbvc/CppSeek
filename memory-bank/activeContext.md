## Most Recent Major Change: FAISS Implementation Strategy & Task 11 Expansion

**Date:** 2025-07-25T08:23:54Z
**Status:** 🔄 **Major refactoring and expansion in progress**

### Major Architecture Decision: FAISS Implementation Strategy

**User Decision Rationale:**
- **Performance Priority**: User explicitly requested FAISS over JSVectorStorage for superior performance and scalability
- **Scalability Requirements**: Need to handle large codebases efficiently with sub-linear search complexity  
- **Industry Standard**: Preference for proven FAISS technology used by major tech companies
- **Long-term Vision**: Willingness to handle native binding complexity for performance gains

**Implementation Strategy Change:**
- **Previous Approach**: Simple JSVectorStorage-only solution (O(n) search complexity)
- **New Approach**: Native FAISS implementation with multiple index types (O(log n) search complexity)
- **Performance Targets**: <5ms search latency for large datasets (50K+ vectors)
- **Index Types**: Support for Flat, IVF, and HNSW indices with automatic selection

### Task 11 Expansion Completed

**Expansion Strategy:**
- **Complex Task Identified**: Task 11 deemed too complex for direct execution (4-6 day estimate)
- **Sub-task Creation**: Expanded into 5 manageable sub-tasks with clear dependencies
- **Task Magic System Used**: Proper task management with detailed specifications

**Created Sub-tasks:**
1. **Task 11.1: FAISS Environment & Dependency Resolution** (Priority: critical)
   - Resolve GLIBC 2.27 dependency issues and faiss-node compatibility
   - Establish working FAISS environment using available GCC 10.3.0 toolchain

2. **Task 11.2: Core FAISS Implementation** (Priority: high)  
   - Implement FAISSVectorStorage core class with basic vector operations
   - Provide foundation FAISS API interface (add, search, manage)

3. **Task 11.3: Multiple Index Types Support** (Priority: high)
   - Support Flat, IVF, HNSW index types with automatic selection
   - Optimize performance for different dataset scales (<1K, 1K-100K, >100K)

4. **Task 11.4: Performance Testing & Benchmarking** (Priority: medium)
   - Establish performance testing framework and validate <5ms search targets
   - Compare FAISS vs JSVectorStorage performance across different scales

5. **Task 11.5: System Integration & Cleanup** (Priority: medium)
   - Complete system integration, update exports, clean legacy code references
   - Ensure end-to-end functionality and VSCode extension integration

**JSVectorStorage Removal Completed:**
- ✅ **Deleted**: `src/services/vectorStorage/jsVectorStorage.ts` (15KB implementation)
- ✅ **Deleted**: `src/services/vectorStorage/memoryMetadataStore.ts` (7KB implementation)  
- ✅ **Deleted**: Associated test files and demo components
- ✅ **Updated**: `src/services/vectorStorage/index.ts` to cleanup phase state
- ✅ **Cleanup**: Removed all JSVectorStorage references from codebase
