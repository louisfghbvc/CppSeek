## Current Work Focus

### Project Status: **IMPLEMENTATION PHASE - Task 1 Complete**
✅ **Task 1 Successfully Completed** (2025-07-15T07:00:47Z)

We have successfully completed **Task 1: Create VSCode extension scaffold** and are now ready to proceed with **Task 2: TypeScript development environment setup**. The foundation VSCode extension is now in place and working correctly.

### ✅ **COMPLETED**: Task 1 - Extension Scaffold Creation
**Achievement**: VSCode extension scaffold successfully created with:
- ✅ Extension ID: `cppseek-semantic-search`
- ✅ Display Name: `CppSeek - Semantic Search`
- ✅ TypeScript compilation working
- ✅ Webpack bundling configured
- ✅ C/C++ activation events set
- ✅ All linting and compilation tests pass
- ✅ Extension can be packaged successfully

### Immediate Priority: **START TASK 2 IMPLEMENTATION**
**Next Action**: Begin implementation of Task 2 - TypeScript development environment setup
**Goal**: Configure TypeScript compilation, install semantic search dependencies, and set up development build system

**Foundation Tasks Status**:
1. **Task 1** (Critical): Create VSCode extension scaffold - ✅ **COMPLETED**
2. **Task 2** (Critical): TypeScript environment setup - **READY TO START** ← **CURRENT FOCUS**
3. **Task 3** (High): Build system and Jest testing - **DEPENDS ON TASK 2**
4. **Task 4** (High): Command registration - **DEPENDS ON TASK 3**

## Recent Decisions

### **NEW**: Task 1 Implementation Decisions
7. **Extension Configuration**: Successfully configured with proper metadata
   - **Extension ID**: `cppseek-semantic-search` (marketplace-ready)
   - **Categories**: `Other, Programming Languages`
   - **Activation Events**: `onLanguage:cpp, onLanguage:c`
   - **Build System**: Webpack with TypeScript compilation

8. **Development Environment**: Established working development setup
   - **TypeScript**: ES2022 target with strict type checking
   - **Webpack**: Production and development builds working
   - **Linting**: ESLint configured and passing
   - **Packaging**: VSCE packaging capability verified

### **CONFIRMED**: Task Management Structure
9. **Task Magic Implementation**: All foundation tasks properly structured
   - **Format**: YAML frontmatter with all required fields
   - **Dependencies**: Clear dependency chain validated (1→2→3→4)
   - **Priorities**: Critical priority for tasks 1-2, High for tasks 3-4
   - **Test Strategies**: Comprehensive validation proven effective

### Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Chunking Strategy**: Fixed-size chunking for Phase 1 simplicity
   - Rationale: Avoid complexity of AST parsing in initial implementation
   - Implementation: 500-token chunks with 50-token overlap for continuity

2. **Embedding Model Selection**: Nvidia llama-3.2-nv-embedqa-1b-v2 for local deployment
   - Reasoning: Local deployment eliminates API dependencies and costs
   - Benefits: Full privacy control and offline capability

3. **Vector Storage**: FAISS for local vector similarity search
   - SQLite for metadata and file information
   - Local-first approach with cloud backup options

### Project Scope Decisions
4. **Phase Simplification**: Reduced from 3 phases to 2 phases (6 weeks total)
   - Rationale: Focus on core semantic search functionality without LLM chat
   - Benefits: Faster time to market, simpler architecture, focused value proposition
   - Trade-offs: No conversational AI interface, but maintains core search value

5. **Nvidia NIM Integration**: Local inference service approach
   - Rationale: Eliminates external API dependencies and costs
   - Implementation: Containerized local deployment
   - Benefits: Full privacy, offline capability, no usage fees

### Technical Approach Confirmed
- **Chunking Strategy**: Fixed-size chunking (Phase 1) → clangd AST-aware (Phase 2)
- **Search Algorithm**: Cosine similarity for vector matching
- **UI Integration**: Command palette + side panel approach
- **Update Strategy**: Incremental indexing with file watchers

## Next Steps

### **IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTION**: Execute Task 2
**Task 2**: Set up TypeScript development environment and dependencies
- **Status**: Ready to start (Task 1 dependency satisfied)
- **Priority**: Critical (enables semantic search dependencies)
