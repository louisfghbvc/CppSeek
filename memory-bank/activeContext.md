# Active Context - CppSeek Extension

## Current Work Focus

### Project Status: **TRANSITION TO IMPLEMENTATION**
We have successfully completed the **detailed task planning phase** for the foundation setup (Tasks 1-4) and are now ready to transition from planning to implementation. All task files are properly structured following the Task Magic system requirements.

### **COMPLETED**: Detailed Task Planning for Foundation Setup
**Achievement**: All foundation setup tasks (1-4) have been planned in detail with:
- ✅ Proper Task Magic YAML frontmatter format
- ✅ Clear dependencies and priority assignments
- ✅ Comprehensive implementation details
- ✅ Complete test strategies for validation
- ✅ Updated TASKS.md master checklist

### Immediate Priority: **START TASK 1 IMPLEMENTATION**
**Next Action**: Begin implementation of Task 1 - Extension scaffold creation
**Goal**: Create the basic VSCode extension structure using `yo code` generator

**Foundation Tasks Ready for Execution**:
1. **Task 1** (Critical): Create VSCode extension scaffold - **READY TO START**
2. **Task 2** (Critical): TypeScript environment setup - **DEPENDS ON TASK 1**  
3. **Task 3** (High): Build system and Jest testing - **DEPENDS ON TASK 2**
4. **Task 4** (High): Command registration - **DEPENDS ON TASK 3**

## Recent Decisions

### **NEW**: Task Management Structure Established
6. **Task Magic Implementation**: All foundation tasks properly structured
   - **Format**: YAML frontmatter with all required fields
   - **Dependencies**: Clear dependency chain from 1→2→3→4
   - **Priorities**: Critical priority for tasks 1-2, High for tasks 3-4
   - **Test Strategies**: Comprehensive validation for each task

### Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Chunking Strategy**: Fixed-size chunking for Phase 1 simplicity
   - Rationale: Avoid complexity of AST parsing in initial implementation
   - Implementation: 500-token chunks with 50-token overlap for continuity

2. **Embedding Model Selection**: Nvidia llama-3.2-nv-embedqa-1b-v2 for local deployment
   - Reasoning: Local deployment eliminates API dependencies and costs
   - Benefits: Full privacy control and offline capability

3. **Vector Storage**: FAISS for local vector similarity search
   - SQLite for metadata and file information
   - Local-first approach with cloud backup options

### Project Scope Decisions
4. **Phase Simplification**: Reduced from 3 phases to 2 phases (6 weeks total)
   - Rationale: Focus on core semantic search functionality without LLM chat
   - Benefits: Faster time to market, simpler architecture, focused value proposition
   - Trade-offs: No conversational AI interface, but maintains core search value

5. **Nvidia NIM Integration**: Local inference service approach
   - Rationale: Eliminates external API dependencies and costs
   - Implementation: Containerized local deployment
   - Benefits: Full privacy, offline capability, no usage fees

### Technical Approach Confirmed
- **Chunking Strategy**: Fixed-size chunking (Phase 1) → clangd AST-aware (Phase 2)
- **Search Algorithm**: Cosine similarity for vector matching
- **UI Integration**: Command palette + side panel approach
- **Update Strategy**: Incremental indexing with file watchers

## Next Steps
