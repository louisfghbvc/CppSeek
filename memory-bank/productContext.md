# Product Context - CppSeek Extension

## Why This Extension Exists

### Current Pain Points
1. **Inefficient Code Discovery**: Developers waste time searching through files manually
2. **Knowledge Gaps**: New team members struggle to understand existing codebases
3. **Limited Search Capabilities**: VSCode's built-in search is purely textual
4. **Context Loss**: Traditional search doesn't understand code relationships

### Market Opportunity
- Growing demand for AI-powered developer tools
- Success of tools like GitHub Copilot and Cursor shows market acceptance
- C/C++ developers have fewer AI tools compared to other languages
- Large codebases in embedded systems, game development, and system programming

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow
1. **Natural Language Query**: User types "Where is the init logic?" in command palette
2. **Semantic Understanding**: System understands intent regardless of exact variable names
3. **Contextual Results**: Returns relevant code snippets with file locations and previews
4. **Interactive Navigation**: Click to jump to source code
5. **Follow-up Questions**: Chat interface for deeper exploration

### Core Features
- **Semantic Search**: Find code by meaning, not exact text
- **Context-Aware Results**: Show function signatures, class hierarchies, and relationships
- **Visual Code Preview**: Inline code snippets with syntax highlighting
- **Smart Ranking**: Prioritize results based on relevance and context
- **Incremental Updates**: Automatically update index as code changes

### Integration Points
- **Command Palette**: Quick access to search functionality
- **Side Panel**: Dedicated search interface
- **Status Bar**: Show indexing progress
- **File Explorer**: Right-click context menu for focused search
- **Editor**: Hover tooltips for semantic information

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **C/C++ Developers**: Working on large codebases
- **System Engineers**: Embedded systems, kernel development
- **Game Developers**: Large game engines and frameworks
- **Open Source Contributors**: Navigating unfamiliar projects

### Use Cases
- **Code Review**: Understanding changed code context
- **Refactoring**: Finding all related functionality
- **Documentation**: Generating code explanations
- **Learning**: Exploring new codebases
- **Debugging**: Locating error sources and related code

## Success Criteria
- Reduces time to find relevant code by 50%
- Improves developer confidence in code exploration
- Achieves 90%+ accuracy in semantic search results
- Seamless integration with existing VSCode workflow
