## Description

Implement intelligent chunk overlap logic that maintains semantic context across chunk boundaries, particularly preserving function signatures, class definitions, and comment blocks.

## Details

### Core Functionality Requirements
- **Semantic Overlap**: Preserve meaningful code context across chunk boundaries
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain function signatures, class definitions, and documentation
- **Adaptive Overlap**: Adjust overlap size based on code structure and semantic importance
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identify and handle overlapping content efficiently
- **Context Metadata**: Track overlapping regions for accurate search result mapping
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient overlap calculation without excessive computation

### Implementation Steps
1. **Create ChunkOverlapManager class** in `src/services/indexing/ChunkOverlapManager.ts`
2. **Implement semantic boundary detection** for functions, classes, and statements
3. **Add adaptive overlap calculation** based on code structure analysis
4. **Implement overlap region tracking** with precise start/end positions
5. **Add context preservation logic** for critical code constructs
6. **Implement duplicate content handling** for search result deduplication
7. **Add overlap quality metrics** to validate context preservation effectiveness

### Semantic Boundary Analysis
```typescript
interface SemanticBoundary {
  type: 'function' | 'class' | 'namespace' | 'comment' | 'preprocessor';
  startLine: number;
  endLine: number;
  startChar: number;
  endChar: number;
  importance: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  context: string; // Function name, class name, etc.
}

interface OverlapRegion {
  chunkA: string;        // Previous chunk ID
  chunkB: string;        // Next chunk ID
  overlapStart: number;  // Start position in chunkA
  overlapEnd: number;    // End position in chunkB
  content: string;       // Overlapping content
  semanticValue: number; // Importance score (0-1)
  boundaries: SemanticBoundary[]; // Preserved constructs
}
```

### Adaptive Overlap Strategy
- **Function Preservation**: Always include complete function signatures in overlap
- **Class Context**: Preserve class declarations and member access specifiers
- **Comment Continuity**: Include relevant documentation and inline comments
- **Preprocessor Handling**: Keep #include and #define statements intact
- **Variable Scope**: Maintain variable declarations that affect following code
- **Template Context**: Preserve template declarations and instantiations

### Context Preservation Rules
1. **Function Signatures**: Include complete function declaration in both chunks
2. **Class Definitions**: Preserve class name and inheritance in overlap
3. **Namespace Context**: Maintain namespace declarations across boundaries
4. **Documentation**: Include preceding comments for functions/classes
5. **Variable Declarations**: Preserve relevant variable and typedef declarations
6. **Macro Definitions**: Include active macro definitions in overlap regions

### Configuration Settings
- `cppseek.overlap.minSize`: Minimum overlap size in tokens (default: 25)
- `cppseek.overlap.maxSize`: Maximum overlap size in tokens (default: 100)
- `cppseek.overlap.adaptiveMode`: Enable adaptive overlap sizing (default: true)
- `cppseek.overlap.preserveFunctions`: Always preserve function signatures (default: true)
- `cppseek.overlap.preserveComments`: Include relevant comments in overlap (default: true)

### Overlap Quality Metrics
```typescript
interface OverlapQuality {
  totalOverlaps: number;
  averageOverlapSize: number;
  semanticPreservation: number; // 0-1 score
  functionsPreserved: number;
  classesPreserved: number;
  commentsPreserved: number;
  duplicateContentRatio: number;
}
```

### Algorithm Flow
1. **Analyze Chunk Boundary**: Identify semantic constructs near chunk end
2. **Calculate Importance**: Score semantic elements for preservation priority
3. **Determine Overlap Size**: Adaptively size overlap to include critical context
4. **Extract Overlap Content**: Extract relevant content from both chunks
5. **Validate Preservation**: Ensure critical constructs are properly preserved
6. **Generate Metadata**: Create overlap tracking information for search

### Integration Points
- **TextChunker**: Receive chunking results and apply overlap logic
- **SemanticAnalyzer**: Use basic syntax analysis for boundary detection
- **SearchEngine**: Provide overlap metadata for result deduplication
- **Configuration Service**: Read overlap preferences and rules
- **Quality Metrics**: Report overlap effectiveness for tuning

### Performance Considerations
- **Boundary Caching**: Cache semantic boundary analysis results
- **Incremental Analysis**: Only re-analyze changed regions
- **Memory Efficiency**: Process overlaps without duplicating large content blocks
- **Parallel Processing**: Analyze multiple chunk boundaries concurrently

## Test Strategy

### Unit Tests
1. **Boundary Detection**: Test semantic boundary identification with various code patterns
2. **Overlap Calculation**: Verify adaptive overlap sizing with different code structures
3. **Context Preservation**: Test preservation of functions, classes, and comments
4. **Duplicate Handling**: Verify overlap content tracking and deduplication logic
5. **Edge Cases**: Test with malformed code, empty chunks, and boundary conditions

### Integration Tests
1. **End-to-End Overlap**: Test complete chunking pipeline with overlap logic
2. **Real Code Analysis**: Test with actual C/C++ projects of varying complexity
3. **Configuration Testing**: Verify behavior with different overlap settings
4. **Performance Integration**: Test overlap processing with large codebases

### Semantic Quality Tests
1. **Function Preservation**: Verify function signatures are preserved across boundaries
2. **Class Context**: Test class definition preservation in overlaps
3. **Comment Continuity**: Verify documentation comments are properly maintained
4. **Variable Scope**: Test variable declaration preservation
5. **Template Handling**: Verify template context preservation

### Performance Tests
1. **Overlap Processing Speed**: Benchmark overlap calculation performance
2. **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption during overlap processing
3. **Scalability**: Test with large numbers of chunks and complex overlap patterns
4. **Cache Effectiveness**: Measure semantic boundary cache hit rates

### Manual Testing
1. **Open complex C++ project** with classes, templates, and heavy commenting
2. **Verify overlap quality** by examining chunk boundaries manually
3. **Test search accuracy** to ensure overlaps don't negatively impact results
4. **Monitor processing time** with overlap logic enabled vs disabled

### Success Criteria
- Preserves 95%+ of critical semantic boundaries (functions, classes)
- Maintains context continuity without excessive overlap (target 50-75 tokens average)
- Processes overlap logic with <20% performance overhead vs basic chunking
- Provides clear overlap metadata for accurate search result mapping
- Demonstrates improved search relevance with context-aware chunking
- Handles edge cases (incomplete functions, malformed code) gracefully
