# Task 1: Create VSCode Extension Scaffold

## Status: PENDING

## Description
Set up the basic VSCode extension structure using the official Yeoman generator (`yo code`). This will create the foundation for the CppSeek semantic search extension.

## Context
This is the first task in Phase 1 of the CppSeek project. We need to establish the basic extension structure that will serve as the foundation for all subsequent development.

## Requirements
- Use `yo code` generator to create extension scaffold
- Configure for TypeScript development
- Set up basic extension manifest (package.json)
- Create initial directory structure
- Configure basic VSCode extension entry point

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Extension scaffold created successfully
- [ ] Extension loads without errors in VSCode
- [ ] Basic command registration works
- [ ] TypeScript configuration is properly set up
- [ ] Extension manifest has correct metadata

## Technical Details

### Prerequisites
```bash
npm install -g yo generator-code
```

### Directory Structure Expected
```
cppseek/
├── src/
│   ├── extension.ts      # Main extension entry point
│   └── test/            # Test files
├── package.json         # Extension manifest
├── tsconfig.json        # TypeScript configuration
├── webpack.config.js    # Build configuration
└── README.md           # Basic documentation
```

### Extension Configuration
- **Extension ID**: cppseek-semantic-search
- **Display Name**: CppSeek - Semantic Search
- **Description**: AI-powered semantic search for C/C++ codebases
- **Categories**: Other, Programming Languages
- **Activation Events**: onLanguage:cpp, onLanguage:c

### Basic Command Setup
```typescript
// Initial command registration
{
  "command": "cppseek.semanticSearch",
  "title": "CppSeek: Semantic Search",
  "category": "CppSeek"
}
```

## Dependencies
- None (this is the first task)

## Estimated Time
- 2-3 hours

## Success Metrics
- Extension can be loaded in VSCode development environment
- Basic command appears in command palette
- No TypeScript compilation errors
- Extension follows VSCode extension best practices

## Next Steps
After completion, proceed to Task 2: Set up TypeScript development environment and dependencies.

## Notes
- Follow VSCode extension development best practices
- Ensure extension can be packaged and distributed later
- Set up proper TypeScript configuration for future development
- Configure webpack for optimal bundle size
