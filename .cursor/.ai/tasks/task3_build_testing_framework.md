## Description

Set up Jest testing framework, configure build scripts, and establish development workflow with proper linting and code quality tools. This creates a robust development environment for the CppSeek extension.

## Details

- Install Jest and related testing dependencies:
  - `jest` (testing framework)
  - `@types/jest` (Jest type definitions)
  - `ts-jest` (TypeScript preprocessing for Jest)
  - `@vscode/test-electron` (VSCode extension testing utilities)
- Configure Jest in `jest.config.js`:
  - Set up TypeScript preprocessing with ts-jest
  - Configure test file patterns (`**/*.test.ts`)
  - Set up test environment for Node.js
  - Configure coverage reporting
  - Set up module path mapping for internal modules
- Create initial test structure:
  - `src/test/suite/index.ts` (test suite runner)
  - `src/test/suite/extension.test.ts` (basic extension tests)
  - `src/test/runTest.ts` (test runner configuration)
- Configure build system improvements:
  - Optimize webpack/esbuild configuration for development and production
  - Set up source map generation for debugging
  - Configure bundle size optimization
  - Add build validation steps
- Set up development workflow scripts:
  - `test`: Run all tests
  - `test:watch`: Watch mode for tests
  - `coverage`: Generate test coverage reports
  - `build`: Production build
  - `build:dev`: Development build with source maps
- Configure continuous integration readiness:
  - Set up test scripts for CI/CD
  - Configure linting as part of build process
  - Add pre-commit hooks configuration

## Test Strategy

- Run `npm test` and verify Jest executes successfully
- Create a simple test case and verify it passes
- Run `npm run test:watch` and verify watch mode works
- Execute `npm run build` and verify production build completes
- Run `npm run coverage` and verify coverage report generation
- Test the extension in development mode and verify debugging works
- Verify that all linting rules pass
- Confirm pre-commit hooks prevent committing failing tests
